# Overview

This project is my first NLP project in Natural Language Processing. In this project I've vectorized the tweets using TD-IDK and Counter-Based Vectorizers, and used Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear SVC models as classifiers.
The objective is to classify whether a tweet is from Donald Trump or Justin Trudeau!

# Libraries
pandas
sklearn (various functions including models, NLP tokenization and evaluation)


# Requirements

The code is written in Python 3.7.6. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.
